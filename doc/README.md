KingPepe Core
=============

Setup
---------------------
KingPepe Core is the original KingPepe client and it builds the backbone of the network. It downloads and, by default, stores the entire history of KingPepe transactions, which requires a few hundred gigabytes of disk space. Depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.

To download KingPepe Core, visit [kingpepecore.org](https://bitcoincore.org/en/download/).

Running
---------------------
The following are some helpful notes on how to run KingPepe Core on your native platform.

### Unix

- `bin/kingpepe-qt` (GUI) or
- `bin/kingpeped` (headless)

### Windows
